Coding Exercise: Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

Objective: Predict sales based on advertising spending in different media channels using various regression algorithms. Perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

Dataset: [Advertising Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/advertising-dataset/)


Tasks:

→ Import at least 3 models

→ Load the Iris dataset.

→ Preprocess the dataset

→ Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

→ Apply model selection

→ Implement the best model based on run_time, rmse, and rmse_cv

→ Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation or Randomized Grid Search Cross-Validation.

→ Train and Test the model using the optimum parameters

→ Show the RMSE and plot the performance of the model
