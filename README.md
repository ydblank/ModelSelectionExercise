Coding Exercise: Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

Objective: Classify Iris flowers into three species using various classification algorithms. Perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

Dataset: Iris Dataset

Tasks:

Load the Iris dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implement a basic classification model (e.g., Decision Tree).
Perform hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation.
Compare the performance of different models.
Evaluate the final model on the test set.
